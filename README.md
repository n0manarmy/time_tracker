# rust_time_tracker
A simple time tracker written in Rust as a way to remember my in and out times while working from home. The app is written in GTK3 and creates a JSON log file of all transactions.

## Future Features
* Add calculations between in and out times in the same span.
* Build some kind of secure ledger that prevents changes to previous times.
